                <p>I am a full stack web developer, in training, and I am passionate about embedded software development for the Internet of Things. Like most developers, I earned my foundational skills by obsessively tinkering with microcontrollers for hours in my garage. My passion for IoT full stack development is uniquely rooted in my long term goal of one day launching a biotech company with a focus on crop yield and irrigation efficiency.</p>

While teaching, exploring, and enjoying the many sights of Japan, I continued to work through the exercises in my intro to Python textbook and I began to study HTML and CSS for web design. As I continued to self study, I also voraciously read books and insightful articles on the topic of successfully launching a tech startup. I am inspired by innovators and entrepreneurs, like Elon Musk, developing IoT solutions for the biggest challenges facing the world today.</p>

                            <p>On November 10th, 2015 I made my final decision to not work another year in Japan, but to instead return home and help my brother with his Ubreakifix repair shops. The opportunity to work with my brother as well as learn the ins and outs of repairing electronics hardware and software felt like killing two birds with one stone. It was as if I had found a bridge into a tech career as well as a front row seat to learning the real challenges of running a small tech business. 

                                Upon returning home, eager to put my Python Coding skills to the test, I also began programming some hello world arduino circuits and testing a recent hydroponic business idea.  
                                
                                Using the money I saved working in Japan I walled off a third of my parents garage and fashioned a laboratory for serious and committed research and experimentation.

                            <p>Everyday after work and school, for about two years, I was completely engrossed with work in my lab. I quickly grew comfortable programming arduinos to switch lights, fans, and pumps on or off depending on sensor feedback. I treated my time in my lab as more than a pastime, my dream of launching a smart hydroponic equipment company pushed me to learn and build ever better prototypes as fast as I could. With research and time my concept shifted from hydroponic towers to shed size fully automated  aquaponic systems, and eventually condensed to a refrigerator sized food computer equipped with a filter of microbes to organically fertilize the enclosed plants. My google drive is overflowing with an expanse of notes ranging from electrical engineering and coding to soil ecology and microbiology. My research last concluded with optimizing the space and equipment in my lab for formulating and fabricating an unique organic fertilizer known as biofertilizers, and I plan to one day launch a biotech manufacturing company in Tampa.</p>
