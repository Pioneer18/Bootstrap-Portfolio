                            <p>After graduating from W&L I was still unsure of what to do with my recently sparked interest in programming, so I chose to teach English in Japan for a year. While teaching, exploring, and soaking up the experiences of Japan, I continued to work through the exercises in my intro to Python textbook and I also began to study HTML and CSS. I relied on resources like Udemy, Codecademy, and Khan Academy to dive deeper into programming fundamentals, and I also discovered a new interest in Arduinos by reading coding blogs and forums. I wasn’t sure that programming microcontrollers could lead to a career, but the low cost and easy enough interface of Arduinos enticed me to try coding with them anyways.</p>

                            <p>On November 10th, 2015 I made my final decision to not work another year in Japan, but to instead return home and help my brother with his Ubreakifix repair shops. The opportunity to work with my brother as well as learn the ins and outs of repairing electronics was too good to pass, it seemed like a nice bridge into a tech career. Eager to put my Python Coding skills to the test, I also began programming some hello world arduino circuits as well as designing a few projects of my own. Soon I was so invested in testing my new ideas that I used a portion of the money I saved working in Japan to wall off a third of my parents’ garage, which built a small workshop for projects.</p>

Since college I have had an interest in environmental conservation and trends like the <a target="blank" href="https://www.slowfood.com/about-us/our-philosophy/">Slow Food Movement</a>. So I combined the programming and hardware skills I had been studying to create automated indoor gardening systems. With time my projects ranged from simple Home Depot buckets with small pumps for watering plants, to a fully automated  aquaponic system that filled the entire room, and eventually even a condensed refrigerator sized food computer equipped with a filter of microbes to organically fertilize the enclosed plants. Over the course of two years I grew comfortable programming arduinos to integrate with sensors and actuators as well as post and request data from the internet. </p>
